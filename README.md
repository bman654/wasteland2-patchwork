# Mod Features

## Free Camera

This mod tweaks the game camera as follows:

* When zooming out, the camera now angles a little bit so you can see further forward
* When zooming in, you can now zoom past the previous limit and get an over the shoulder view of the WasteLand.

## Free Combat Camera

Originally developed by **Staehrminator** over on the [InXile Forums](https://forums.inxile-entertainment.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=10808&sid=96e870ee7082bbec1bb91f373d5ea3ec).

This little hack stops the camera from automatically jerking around during combat. 
It will now stay put unless you move it manually, and you can now also move it when it's not your turn.
If you want to zoom in on an enemy before you eviscerate them, or have a constant view of the battlefield like the tactical god you are, well, now you can!

More later.  For now, read through the Patchwork and IEMod instructions.  This is very similar.

# Special Thanks
This mod is powered by the [Patchwork](https://github.com/GregRos/Patchwork) framework (that also powers  that powers the [IEMod](https://github.com/GregRos/IEMod.pw)).  Special thanks to the authors of that framework.
