## Free Camera

This mod tweaks the game camera as follows:

* When zooming out, the camera now angles a little bit so you can see further forward
* When zooming in, you can now zoom past the previous limit and get an over the shoulder view of the WasteLand.

More later.  For now, read through the Patchwork and IEMod instructions.  This is very similar.


# Special Thanks
This mod is powered by the [Patchwork](https://github.com/GregRos/Patchwork) framework (that also powers  that powers the [IEMod](https://github.com/GregRos/IEMod.pw)).  Special thanks to the authors of that framework.
